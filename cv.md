I’m last year student of economic university, studding the World Economy at International Investment Department. As I’m interested in self-development and IT I started to study HTML and CSS on the www.htmlacademy.ru  by myself. During this summer I finished IT-school MYFREEDOM. Now I’m student of IT Academy studding “Developing web Application in JavaScript” course. I decided to learn JavaScript because the internet, it is obvious, that almost 95% of websites use JS anyway. The most popular browsers support this language. The decision comes easy. To know JavaScript means to have a stable job and lead to success.
